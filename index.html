No monthly payments are required during your lifetime if you remain in the home. Funds can be received as a lump sum, monthly payments, or line of credit. The loan is only repaid when you sell the home, move, or pass away. This can be beneficial for seniors needing funds for healthcare or living expenses."

                            "content": "Unlike traditional mortgages, reverse mortgages don't require monthly payments. Interest is added to the loan balance over time instead. This reduces strain on fixed incomes during retirement. You maintain full ownership of your home. However, the growing debt can significantly reduce the inheritance left to heirs."

These costs can range from 2-5% of the home's value. The longer you keep the loan, the more interest accumulates. Total costs could exceed 50% of your home's value over time. It's important to understand all fees before committing."

Your heirs will need to repay the loan or sell the home to settle the debt. If the home value hasn't increased significantly, there may be little to no inheritance left. However, heirs are not personally liable for any shortfall if the home sells for less than owed."

However, Social Security and Medicare are generally not impacted. The loan balance counts as an asset for benefit determination purposes. It's crucial to understand how this might affect your overall financial situation. Consult with a financial advisor before proceeding."
